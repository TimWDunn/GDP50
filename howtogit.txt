Conor commits and pushes to his own github account, which has been forked off of mine. 
He can make changes, and create his own branches as he wishes and update his work in his github repository. 
From here, he submits a pull request to me. I can see what has been changed and see if it is possible to merge the 2 versions of the file.
If I accept, Conor's changes will be merged into my main folder.
I can then PULL using tortoise git, from origin, and it will update my local files on my computer so I can load his work. 

Can you see this?
